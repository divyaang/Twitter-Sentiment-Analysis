# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

In this project, I have done some Natural Language Processing on the Twitter US Airline Sentiment Dataset, which contains data for over 14000 tweets. Then I have used some classifiers namely, Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Descision Trees to predict the sentiment of the tweet i.e. positive, negative or neutral.

This project was done as a part of Data Science and Machine Learning course offered by Coding Ninjas.
